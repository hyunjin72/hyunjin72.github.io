        <p>I am a Ph.D student at <a href="https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/">Machine Learning and Intelligence Lab (MLILAB)</a> at KAIST, under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UWO1mloAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Eunho Yang</a>. 
            My research primarily focuses on the practical applications of structured data and geometric deep learning. My work includes developing data and model pruning techniques to address the computational challenges associated with training large-scale graphs. 
            Additionally, I have focused on enhancing representation learning on text-attributed graphs under the supervision of large language models (LLMs). 
            Currently, my primary research interest lies in addressing <u>multimodal complex reasoning</u> by leveraging relational information within a graph-based framework.</p>
